# Configuration

## Remote Credentials

By default the toolbox will only run locally and without any GCS storage of your experiments. If you want to integrate the `mle-toolbox` with your SGE/Slurm clusters, you have to provide additional data. There 2 ways to do so:

1. After installation type `mle init`. This will walk you through all configuration steps in your CLI and save your configuration in `~/mle_config.toml`.
2. Manually edit the [`template_config.toml`](https://github.com/RobertTLange/mle-toolbox/tree/main/templates/template_config.toml) template. Move/rename the template to your home directory via `mv template_config.toml ~/mle_config.toml`.

The configuration procedure consists of 3 optional steps, which depend on your needs:

1. Set whether to store all results & your database locally or remote in a GCS bucket.
2. Add SGE and/or Slurm credentials & cluster-specific details (headnode, partitions, proxy server, etc.).
3. Add the GCP project, GCS bucket name and database filename to store your results.
