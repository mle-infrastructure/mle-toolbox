# Welcome to the MLE-Toolbox

ML researchers need to coordinate different types of experiments on separate remote resources. The *Machine Learning Experiment (MLE)-Toolbox* is designed to facilitate the workflow by providing a simple interface, standardized logging, many common ML experiment types (multi-seed/configurations, grid-searches and hyperparameter optimization pipelines). You can run experiments on your local machine, high-performance compute clusters ([Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html) and [Sun Grid Engine](http://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/intro2UnixandSGE/sun_grid_engine_for_beginners/README.html)) as well as on cloud VMs ([GCP](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/)). The results are archived (locally/[GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/products/storage/)) and can easily be retrieved or automatically summarized/reported as `.md`/`.html` files.

## What Does The `mle-toolbox` Provide?

1. API for launching jobs on cluster/cloud computing platforms (Slurm, GridEngine, GCP).
2. Common machine learning research experiment setups:
    - Launching and collecting multiple random seeds in parallel/batches.
    - Hyperparameter searches: Random, Grid, SMBO, Population-Based Training.
    - Pre- and post-processing pipelines for data prep/result visualization.
3. Automated report generation for hyperparameter searches.
4. Storage of results and database in Google Cloud Storage Bucket.
5. Resource monitoring with dashboard visualization.

## 5 Steps To Get Started :stew:

1. Follow the [installation instructions](setup/installation/) and set up your credentials/configurations.
2. Read the [docs](setup/infrastructure/) to learn about the toolbox and `.json` & `.yaml` configuration files.
3. Watch the [YouTube Tutorials series](setup/video_tutorials/) for a hands-on walkthrough.
4. Check out and re-run the [examples :page_facing_up:](https://github.com/RobertTLange/mle-toolbox/tree/main/examples) to get comfortable.
5. Run your own experiments using the [template files](https://github.com/RobertTLange/mle-toolbox/tree/main/templates), [project](https://github.com/RobertTLange/mle-project-template) and `mle run`.


## Core Commands of the Toolbox :seedling:

You are now ready to dive deeper into the specifics of [job configuration](setup/infrastructure/) and can start running your first experiments from the cluster (or locally on your machine) with the commands:

1. **Initial setup of credentials & toolbox settings**: `mle init`
2. **Start up an experiment**: `mle run <exp_config>.yaml`
3. **Monitor resource utilisation**: `mle monitor`
4. **Retrieve an experiment result**: `mle retrieve`
5. **Create an experiment report with figures**: `mle report`
6. **Extract all GCS-stored results to local drive**: `mle sync-gcs`
